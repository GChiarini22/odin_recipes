              <h2>An Easy, Delicious Dessert</h2>
                  <div>Arroz con leche (aka rice pudding) is a dish I grew up eating all the time. I grew up in Miami with two immigrant parents. My mother who was Brazilian, and my father who was Argentinian. I had access to all the sugary treats available in the US, like M&Ms, but my mom regularly made arroz con leche and I fondly remember how I would gobble it up until the last rice kernel everytime. It's a classic struggle meal dessert that you can find all over South and Central America.</div>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>7 cups water</li>
                    <li>1 cup of long grain white rice</li>
                    <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
                    <li>1 12 oz. can evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>1 14 oz. can sweetened evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>cinnamon</li>
                  </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Add water, rice and cinnamon sticks to a large saucepan and cook on medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and let cook for 16-18 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain liquid from the sauce pan, remove cinnamon sticks and put rice back in the pan. Add all 3 milks - evaporated milk, condensed milk and whole milk to the pan. Let come to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring constantly. The milk can easily burn so it's important to stir as much as possible as it thickens.</li>
                    <li>Pour rice into cups and sprinkle on cinnamon. If you like more cinnamon, add 1 tsp of cinnamon in when adding the milks. Serve warm.</li>
                  </ol>
